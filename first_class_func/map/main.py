Map
"Map", "filter", and "reduce" are three commonly used higher-order functions in functional programming.

In Python, the built-in map function takes a function and an iterable (in this case a list) as inputs. It returns an iterator that applies the function to every item, yielding the results.

map function

With map, we can operate on lists without using loops and nasty stateful variables. For example:

def square(x):
    return x * x

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_nums = map(square, nums)
print(list(squared_nums))
# [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

The list type constructor, list() converts the map object back into a standard list.

Assignment
Markdown supports two different styles of bullet points, - and *. We prefer *, so, we need a function to convert any - bullet points to * bullet points.

Complete the change_bullet_style function. It takes a document (a string) as input, and returns a single string as output. The returned string should have any lines that start with a - character replaced with a * character.

For example, this:

- This is a bullet
- This is a bullet
Copy icon
Becomes:

* This is a bullet
* This is a bullet
Copy icon
Use the built-in map function to apply the provided convert_line function to each line of the input string. Use .split() and .join() to split the document into a list of lines, and then join the lines back together. This should preserve the original line breaks. Don't use the .replace() string method.

Examples of split and join:

# my_document is a string with newlines
lines_list = my_document.split("\n")

rejoined_doc = "\n".join(lines_list)
Copy icon
Tip
The splitlines method does not preserve trailing newlines and may cause your output to fail the tests.
