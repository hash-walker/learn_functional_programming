Reduce
The built-in functools.reduce() function takes a function and a list of values, and applies the function to each value in the list, accumulating a single result as it goes.

reduce function

# import functools from the standard library
import functools

def add(sum_so_far, x):
    print(f"sum_so_far: {sum_so_far}, x: {x}")
    return sum_so_far + x

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
sum = functools.reduce(add, numbers)
# sum_so_far: 1, x: 2
# sum_so_far: 3, x: 3
# sum_so_far: 6, x: 4
# 10 doesn't print, it's just the final result
print(sum)
# 10

Assignment
Complete the join and the join_first_sentences functions.

join()
This is a helper function we'll use in join_first_sentences. It takes two inputs:

A "doc_so_far" accumulator string. It's similar to the sum_so_far variable in the example above.
A "sentence" string. This is the next string we want to add to the accumulator.
It returns the result of concatenating the "doc" and "sentence" strings together, with a period and a space in between. For example:

doc = "This is the first sentence"
sentence = "This is the second sentence"
print(join(doc, sentence))
# This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence
Copy icon
join_first_sentences()
It accepts two arguments:

A list of sentence strings
An integer n
It should use the built-in functools.reduce() function alongside your join function to return a single string: the result of joining the first n sentences in the list. It should also add a final period (but no trailing space) to the end of the final "reduced" string.

If n is zero, just return an empty string.

Use list slicing to get the first n sentences. For example:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
print(fruits[:2])
# ["apple", "banana"]
Copy icon
Here's an example of the expected behavior:

joined = join_first_sentences(
    ["This is the first sentence", "This is the second sentence", "This is the third sentence"],
    2
)
print(joined)
# This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence.

    return f"{doc_so_far}. {sentence}"


def join_first_sentences(sentences, n):
    if n == 0:
        return ""

    return f"{functools.reduce(join, sentences[:n])}."
