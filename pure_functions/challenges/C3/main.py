Organize Keywords
By organizing keywords, documents are mapped to their relevant terms, enabling users to quickly view the keywords associated with each document. It also reduces the computational overhead of repeatedly searching for the same terms, improving the performance and responsiveness of Doc2Doc. This is useful for notebooking, research and project management.

Assignment
Complete the find_keywords function. It takes as input a document string and returns a list of the keyword substrings in the document.

The keywords list is being modified at the start of code execution. Turn find_keywords into a pure function that does not rely on a global variable.

Move the keywords list inside of the find_keywords function so changes to the global scope do not change this list.
Filter the keywords to create a new list containing only the keyword substrings in the document.
Be sure to return the found keyword substrings as a list.
Fix the map_keywords function. It takes a string document input and a dictionary document_map input, and returns a list of keywords substrings found in the document and a dictionary document_map with the document added if needed. The document_map dictionary has document strings as keys, and their values are a list of keywords found in the key string, in the order they appear in the keywords list.

Do not modify or return the actual input document_map.
If the document is already in the document map, return its keywords and the document_map copy.
Use find_keywords to get the keyword substrings in the document.
Add the document and its keyword substrings to the document_map copy.
Return the document's keyword substrings and the document_map copy.
Tip
Check the test suite to understand how variables are being changed in the global scope.
