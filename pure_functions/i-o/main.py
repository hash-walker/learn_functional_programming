Input and Output
xkcd "side effects"

Comic by xkcd.

The term "i/o" stands for input/output. In the context of writing programs, i/o refers to anything in our code that interacts with the "outside world". "Outside world" just means anything that's not stored in our application's memory (like variables).

Examples of I/O
Reading from or writing to a file on the hard drive
Accessing the internet
Reading from or writing to a database
Even simply printing to the console is considered i/o!
All i/o is a form of "side effect".

Assignment
In Doc2Doc, we frequently need to change the casing of some text. For example:

TitleCase
Every Day Once A Day Give Yourself A Present

LowerCase
every day once a day give yourself a present

UpperCase
EVERY DAY ONCE A DAY GIVE YOURSELF A PRESENT

There is an issue in the convert_case function, our test suite can't test its behavior because it's printing to the console (eww... a side-effect) instead of returning a value. Fix the function so that it returns the correct value instead of printing it.

def convert_case(text, target_format):
    if not text or not target_format:
        raise ValueError(f"No text or target format provided")

    if target_format == "uppercase":
        return text.upper()
    if target_format == "lowercase":
        return text.lower()
        
    if target_format == "titlecase":
        return text.title()
    raise ValueError(f"Unsupported format: {target_format}")
