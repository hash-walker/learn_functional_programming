It's Math
Functional programming tends to be popular amongst developers with a strong mathematical background. After all, a math equation isn't procedural: it's declarative. Take the following math equation:

avg = Σx/N

To put this calculation in plain English:

Σ is just the Greek letter Sigma, and it represents "the sum of a collection".
x is the collection of numbers we're averaging.
N is the number of elements in the collection.
avg is equal to the sum of all the numbers in collection "x" divided by the number of elements in collection "x".
So, the equation really just says that avg is the average of all the numbers in collection "x". This math equation is a declarative way of writing "calculate the average of a list of numbers". Here's some imperative Python code that does the same thing:

def get_average(nums):
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        total += num
    return total / len(nums)

However, with functional programming, we would write code that's a bit more declarative:

def get_average(nums):
    return sum(nums) / len(nums)
Copy icon
Here we're not keeping track of state (the total variable in the first example is "stateful"). We're simply composing functions together to get the result we want.

Assignment
In the world of document conversion, we sometimes need to handle fonts and font sizes.

Complete the get_median_font_size function. Given a list of numbers representing font sizes, return the median of the list.

For example:

[1, 2, 3] => 2
[10, 8, 7, 5] => 7
Copy icon
Notice the second list is out of order. Order the list, then find the middle index, and return the middle number. If there is an even amount of numbers, return the smaller of the two middle numbers (I know it's not a true median, but good for our purposes). If the list is empty, just return None.

Here are some helpful docs:

sorted
len
// (floor division)
To be a good little functional programmer, your code for this lesson should not:

Use loops
Mutate any variables (it's okay to create new ones)
"""

def get_median_font_size(font_sizes):
    if len(font_sizes):
        return sorted(font_sizes)[(len(font_sizes) - 1) // 2]
    else:
        return None
